## Introduction to Git and Github

For this first part, go to my slide set overview at [http://melindahiggins2000.github.io/web2/teaching/CDCslidesMar2016/#1](http://melindahiggins2000.github.io/web2/teaching/CDCslidesMar2016/#1).

These slides cover the information on:
* GIT [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
* Github [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
* Github Desktop Client [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Files, Code and Data for this workshop

You can download all of the data, code and files for this workshop at my Github repository at [https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/CDCRworkshopCode](https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/CDCRworkshopCode). From here click on "Download ZIP" to download everything to your local computer/storage location. You could also "fork" my repository and then "clone" it to your local computer.

I also built a Github repository for this Gitbook "CDC R Workshop". Here are the relevant links:
* my Github repository for the book [https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/CDCRworkshop](https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/CDCRworkshop)
* the final Gitbook [https://www.gitbook.com/book/melindahiggins2000/cdcrworkshop/details](https://www.gitbook.com/book/melindahiggins2000/cdcrworkshop/details)
* and if you'd like to create your own Gitbook [https://www.gitbook.com/](https://www.gitbook.com/)

## Explore RStudio
1. Open/Run RStudio
2. Explore the windows and menus
3. See what your settings are in "Tools"/"Global Options"
   + change your "Appearance" to a font size and theme you like
   + take a look at the other options but leave the defaults for now
4. Create a New File - go to "File"/"New File"/"R Script"
    + This will create a new (blank) window at the top left where you can type in an execute R commands. This is similar to the SAS program window.
    + As you type in commands you can select the command (or commands) you want to execute and click "Run" or go to the end of the line and hit "Cntl-Enter".
    + You can also execute commands in the Console window (lower left) but this is like typing commands in at the command line and harder to enter longer commands and edit as needed.
    + However as you run commands from the R Script window, they are echo'd in the Console window. And output is also shown in the console window as appropriate.
    
## Begin writing code in your new script window.

Now that you have your R Script window open, go ahead and save it somewhere on your computer/local storage location (e.g. flash drive, cloud or network drive). Click "File"/"Save As"/ and enter in a name for your file "myfile.r". If you leave off the ".r" extension, it should be added automatically for you. Open your local drive and check to make sure the file saved correctly.

As you enter code, it is always a good idea to add informative comments as you go. The number sign `#` is the delimiter R uses to denote comments. Anything typed after the `#` is echo'd to the screen and not executed. You'll also notice that the R scripting window inside RStudio trys to be helpful by color coding different commands, functions, variables and such so you notice each is handled differently. The comments will be a different color than commands R is trying to execute as code.

Let's try the following code `getwd()` to see what R thinks is your current "home" directory.

```
# ======================================
# see what directory R is currently set to
getwd()

# ======================================
# change your "working directory"
# to a location of your choice
setwd('C:/MyGithub/CDCRworkshopCode')

# ======================================
# check location again
getwd()
```
