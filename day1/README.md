    + create a scatterplot, add the linear fit line and a non-parametric lowess smoothed fit line in different colors - using base R graphics
    + update the scatterplot with the 2 fit lines using ggplot2
    + add panels using facets in ggplot2
    + learn about creating and using variables as factors * looking closer at the linear fit model - the lm objects
